I've tried (almost) all of my email accounts over at Pottermore, now, and am pretty 'fucken' ecstatic about the results.  When I originally joined the Pottermore site, I got some pretty generic stuff in that I don't know that I put nearly as much effort into it as I did tonight.  I'm not just talking about trying each of my email addresses, which is what I'm doing tonight, but actually retaking every test and comparing all the results at once.

<u>Gmail (Takes 1-3)</u>
<b>Hogwarts House:</b> Slytherin (which I don't mind at all, actually...).  
<b>Ilvermorny House:</b> Horned Serpent.  
<b>Wand:</b> Redwood, unicorn hair, 12 ¼", quite bendy.
<b>Patronus:</b> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocicat" target="_blank">Ocicat</a>, <a href="" target="_blank">Polecat</a> (why am I frickin' ferret? *not actually asking*  This was from two different Gmail accounts *hackable* I should try a different one I still have because, possibilities...damn it, not yet.  TBC...).

<u>Protonmail</u> - <b>Hogwarts House:</b> Slytherin (AGAIN?  <i>Now</i>, I mind it!). 
<b>Ilverymorny House:</b> Pukwudgie. 
Wand: Ash, Unicorn hair, 10", Unyielding.
Patronus: Wolf, because awesomesauce.

<u>Tutanota</u> - <b>Hogwarts House:</b> Ravenclaw (this is me forcing myself to be civilized while writing for clarity's sake; inside I'm dancing to <a href="" target="_blank">Fall Out Boy's 'Novocaine'</a> at FINALLY GETTING THE HOUSE I AM FIT FOR, even though I have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQjEQBsYE3Q" target="_blank&quot;">Logic's 'Africaaryan'</a> in my head, currently).
<b>Ilvermorny House:</b> Thunderbird, ditto for Slytherin, take 2.
<b>Wand:</b> Cedar wood with a unicorn hair core, 11" and quite bendy flexibility.
<b>Patronus:</b> King cobra, because, WOW.

I think I will consider this my <i>main</i>, <b>actual</b> Pottermore account unless something (<i>MASSIVE</i>) happens to top it in my esteem.

<u>iCloud</u> - <b>Hogwarts House:</b> Hufflepuff (YES! <b>NOT</b> Gryffindor! I've been Sorted into that House by other quizzes FAR TOO OFTEN. My bravery is secondary to my ability to think things through!).
<b>Ilvermorny House:</b> Thunderbird.
<b>Wand:</b> <a href="https://www.woodworkerssource.com/shop/category/Pearwood_African.html" target="_blank">Pearwood</a> (which I did not know was a thing, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tortoiseshell_cat" target="_blank">tortoiseshell cats</a>. Learn every day...) with a Dragon heartstring core 12 ½" and slightly yielding flexibility.
<b>Patronus:</b> Tortoiseshell cat.

This entire experiment was prompted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheJongasm" target="_blank&quot;">Jon Solo</a>'s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3_igyQbq9s" target="_blank">Sorting</a> on Youtube, so I thank him.
