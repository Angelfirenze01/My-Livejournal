In light of realizing how good I have it with regard to privacy, I've retracted my previous comments and invite all who are interested in anything I have to say to follow my journal, but will no longer solicit responses or public attention.

I appreciate all viewpoints and encourage anyone to share, but unless someone wants to take the time to comment so they will be recognized and friended back, their enjoyment of my journal will be one-sided.

Re: fanfiction: I am delighted to open anything I've written to those who would request whichever story (stories?) they would like to read in comments below.  Feel free to simply ask.
